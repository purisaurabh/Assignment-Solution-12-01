-> cherry pick is used to pick or choose the individual commits and apply them to the current 
   branch rather than merging the entire branch

  command : git cherry-pick <commmit_ID>

  use case :
	When you want to settle the particular error in a particulat commit from then we can use
        cherry pick to get that commit from one branch to another branch without merging the entire
        branch

  steps : 
	
	1) git log :
                     by this we can get the particular commit and commit id where we have to fix
                     the error
        2) git checkout branch_name : 
                     switch the branch where we want to apply the commit 
        3) git cherry-pick commit_ID : 
                     perform cherry pick to that particular commit
