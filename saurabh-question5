Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also
 you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

-> --force and --force-with-lease are both opiton are used with git push when you need
     to forcefully update the code on remote repo 

    -- force : 
                when we used --force with git push it means you are telling to git to ignore what 
       is on the remote server and just push your changes even if it means overwriting or erasing 
       what is already there

    command :
                git push --force origin branch_name


    
    --force-with-lease :
                 when we use --force-with-lease it means we tell git I want to push my code but
         only if nobody else push anything new
         
      command :
                   git push --force-with-lease origin branch_name

      Scenario :
             1) You and  your teammate are worling on the same branch
             2) If someone else pushed chnages your push is rejected it prevent the data loss
