git Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 

-> For combining the two commits in one commit you have to use the git rebase 
   steps to follow

   1) git branch -b branch_name : to create the new branch
   2) then add upto four commit in that particular branch by
	git add .
	git commit  -m "commit msg"
   3) then we have to do the squash got that we use
	git rebase -i HEAD~4 
	from above command we can sqaush the recent four commit
   4) then all commit appear as pick then if we have to combine c2 and c3 them instead of pick
      front of c3 we have to write the 's'
   5) then we save the file 
   6) after this another terminal will open
   7) after we again save the file
   4) then we  remove the comment of the selective commtit 
   5) By saving the file  we can combine the two or many commit
